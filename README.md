## 🗂️ What is it?

**Taskflow** is a **to-do list** application — a modern and intuitive task manager, designed with simplicity and performance in mind.

You probably know those lists we write on paper so we don't forget anything?
"Do my homework", "call grandma", "finish the project"...

Taskflow is exactly that, but on your computer or phone. And way better than a piece of paper, because:

- you can **check off** a task when you're done ✅
- you can give it a **priority** (urgent, normal, not in a hurry)
- you can put it in a **category** you create yourself (e.g. "School", "Personal", "Sport")
- you can set a **deadline** so you never miss an important due date
- **everything is saved automatically** — even if you close the tab, nothing disappears
- you can **filter, sort and search** through your list in a few clicks

---

## ✨ Features

### Data flow

1. **Add task**: Input → `main.js` → `store.addTodo()` → Re-render → DOM
2. **Delete task**: Delete button → `store.deleteTodo()` → Re-render → DOM
3. **Complete task**: Checkbox → `store.toggleTodo()` → Re-render → DOM
4. **Search/Filter**: Input → `store.setSearch()` → `store.getFiltered()` → Re-render
5. **Export**: `store.exportTodos()` → JSON serialization → File download
6. **Import**: File upload → JSON parsing → `store.importTodos()` → Re-render

### State management

The application uses a **centralized reactive store** (`store.js`) with a mini event-emitter pattern:

- All data mutations go through store functions
- Every change automatically triggers a re-render
- Data is persisted in `localStorage` after every mutation
- Filters, sort and search are applied in real time

**Advantages:**
- No external framework needed
- Automatic persistence — nothing is lost on page reload
- Clean separation between data and UI
- Lightweight and fast

---

## 📥 Export & Import

### Export (save)
Click the **⬇️ Export** button in the top right corner.
This downloads a `.json` file to your computer.
This file contains all your tasks. Keep it safe as a backup!

### Import (restore)
Click the **⬆️ Import** button, then select a `.json` file you previously exported.
All your tasks reappear instantly.

> 💡 The JSON format is simply a text file that computers can read easily. You can open it with any text editor to see your tasks in a structured format.

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Do my tasks disappear if I close the browser?**
No! Everything is saved automatically in your browser. You can close it, restart your computer, reopen the browser — your tasks are still there.

**Are my data lost if I switch browsers?**
Yes, unfortunately. Data is linked to your specific browser. If you switch from Chrome to Firefox, you won't find your tasks there. The solution: export your list to JSON from the old browser, then import it in the new one.

**Does it work on my phone?**
Yes! The app adapts to small screens automatically. You can use it on Android or iPhone directly from your mobile browser.

**Can I share my list with someone?**
Not directly from the app for now. But you can export your list as a JSON file and send it by email. That person can then import it into their own version of Taskflow.

**What happens if I clear my browser cache?**
Your tasks will be deleted, as they are stored in the localStorage cache. To avoid losing your data, remember to regularly export your list to JSON — that's your backup.

**Is the app free forever?**
Yes, 100%. Taskflow is open source and under the MIT license. There will never be a subscription, a paid version, or advertising.

**I'm a beginner — can I contribute to the project?**
Of course! Even reporting a bug or suggesting an idea in the [Issues](https://github.com/madjeek-web/Taskflow_to-do-list/issues) is already a contribution. Everyone is welcome.

## 🙏 Credits & acknowledgements

Taskflow could not have existed without these open source tools and projects:

- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) — The tool that compiles and optimises the project
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) — The CSS framework that handles the design
- [**Tabler Icons**](https://tabler.io/icons) — The icon library

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) — Hosting for the code and the live demo

A big thank you to the open source community that makes projects like this one possible. 🙌

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### The development server won't start

```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Tailwind CSS errors

```bash
# Check the Vite configuration
# Make sure @tailwindcss/vite is installed
npm install
```

### Import/export not working

- Check that your browser allows file downloads
- Make sure the JSON file is valid
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors

### Tasks disappeared after clearing cache

Your tasks are stored in `localStorage`. If you cleared your browser data, the tasks are gone. This is why regular JSON exports are recommended as backups.

### Flux de données

1. **Ajout de tâche** : Input → main.js → DOM → components.js
2. **Suppression** : Bouton supprimer → main.js → Mise à jour DOM
3. **Marquage complétée** : Checkbox → main.js → Mise à jour classe CSS
4. **Export** : Récupération DOM → Sérialisation JSON → Téléchargement
5. **Import** : Upload fichier → Parsing JSON → Injection dans DOM

### Gestion d'état

L'état de l'application est stocké dans le **DOM lui-même**. Chaque tâche est représentée par un élément HTML avec :
- Un attribut `data-*` pour le statut de complétion
- Des classes CSS pour la visualisation
- Des événements DOM pour la manipulation

**Avantages:**
- Pas de framework externe
- Pas de dépendances de gestion d'état
- Simple et transparent
- Légère et performante

**Limitations:**
- L'état est perdu au rechargement de la page (pas de persistance)
- L'import/export est manuel (pas de sauvegarde automatique)

## Fonctionnalités avancées

### Persistance des données

Actuellement, l'application ne persiste pas les données automatiquement. Pour une persistance complète, vous pouvez :

**Option 1: LocalStorage**
```javascript
// Sauvegarder après chaque changement
localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(tasks));

// Restaurer au chargement
const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todos'));
```

**Option 2: Backend Database**
- Intégrer une API REST
- Synchroniser avec un serveur (Firebase, MongoDB, etc.)
- Synchronisation en temps réel multi-appareils

### Améliorations futures possibles

- 🔐 Authentification utilisateur
- ☁️ Synchronisation cloud
- 🏷️ Catégories et tags
- 📅 Dates d'échéance
- 🔔 Notifications et rappels
- 🎨 Thèmes personnalisables
- 📱 Application mobile native
- ⌨️ Raccourcis clavier

# 🔒 Security & Privacy — Taskflow

> **One sentence summary:** Taskflow collects no data, connects to no server, and everything stays on your computer. Full stop.

---

## 🛡️ What Taskflow does with your data

### The short answer: absolutely nothing.

Taskflow is an application that runs **entirely in your browser**, on your own computer. There is no server behind it, no database somewhere in the cloud, no company receiving anything whatsoever.

Here is a clear table of what the application does — and does not do — with your information:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| 📡 Does the app send my tasks over the internet? | **No, never.** |
| 👀 Can someone see my tasks? | **No, nobody.** |
| 🍪 Does the app use cookies? | **No.** |
| 📊 Is there any analytics or tracking? | **No.** |
| 💰 Is my data sold? | **No, impossible.** |
| 🔑 Do I need to create an account? | **No account required.** |
| 📧 Do I need to provide my email? | **No, never.** |
| 🌐 Do I need an internet connection? | **No, it works offline.** |

---

## 💾 Where is my data stored?

Your tasks are saved in what is called your browser's **`localStorage`**.

To put it simply: it's a small storage space that your browser makes available to websites and web apps, **directly on your computer**. It's exactly like a text file saved on your desktop, except it's managed automatically by the browser.

**What this means in practice:**

- ✅ Your data **never leaves** your computer
- ✅ Even Fabien Conéjéro, the creator of Taskflow, **cannot see** your tasks
- ✅ No internet connection is needed for the app to work
- ✅ If you want to erase everything, simply clear your browser's localStorage (or delete the file)

---

## 🌐 What about the Google Fonts connection?

The online version of Taskflow loads fonts (typefaces) from **Google Fonts**. This is only to make the text look nice.

This connection is **the one and only** network communication the app makes, and it transmits none of your tasks — just a font file request, like any website that displays styled text.

> 💡 **If you use the `taskflow-standalone.html` version** offline, even this connection does not happen. The app works perfectly with your system's default fonts.

---

## 🔍 How to verify this yourself

You don't have to take our word for it. Here's how to check for yourself that Taskflow sends nothing over the internet:

1. **Open Taskflow** in your browser
2. **Press F12** (or right-click → "Inspect")
3. Go to the **"Network"** tab
4. **Add tasks**, check them off, delete some...
5. Look at the network requests: you will see **no personal data** leaving anywhere

This is what we call **transparency through code** — the full source code is available on this GitHub repository, and anyone can read it and verify what it does.

---

## 📂 The source code is open

Taskflow is an **open source** project. This means that **all the code is visible** to anyone, at any time, on this GitHub repository.

There is no hidden code, no secret part, no mysterious file running in the background. What you see in the files is exactly what the application does — nothing more, nothing less.

> 💡 **For developers:** the entire codebase is available in the `src/` folder. The `store.js` file handles all data — you can verify that no function makes any outgoing HTTP request.

---

## 🧹 How to delete all my data

If you want to cleanly erase everything, you have two options:

**Option 1 — From the browser**
1. Press `F12` to open the developer tools
2. Go to the **"Application"** tab (Chrome) or **"Storage"** tab (Firefox)
3. Click on **"localStorage"**
4. Find the entry **`taskflow-v3`** and delete it

**Option 2 — Clear the browser cache**
Go to your browser settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Site data. Note that this will also delete data from all other websites.

---

## 🚨 Reporting a security vulnerability

Found a security issue in Taskflow? Please do not expose it publicly in a GitHub Issue.

Contact the creator directly by opening an Issue labelled **`[SECURITY]`** with a general description of the problem, without sharing the technical details publicly. We will respond quickly to fix it.

---

## ✅ Summary for parents and teachers

Taskflow is a **100% local** application that:

- Creates no user account
- Asks for no personal information
- Connects to no external server (except for loading fonts)
- Contains no advertising
- Sells no data
- Is entirely free and open source

It is as safe as a simple text file on your desktop.
